											<h4>Effects of disturbances on microbial community dynamics in distribution systems.</h4>
										<div class="features">
											<article>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
													<p>Shifts in
															microbial community composition can occur because
															of local or site-to-site variations
															or system-scale changes that affect the whole
															distribution system. Intentional disturbances
															from drinking water treatment facility operations improve water
															quality in the long-term, but can have unintended consequences.
															The goal of this project is to
															investigate the effect of disturbances on
															microbial communities in distribution systems and inform management practices.</p>

												<h4>Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for potable reuse</h4>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
													<p>Advanced-treated wastewater can be used as a source of drinking water through direct potable reuse.
													 WBE can help ensure ingestion of recycled water does not result in increased enteric
														diseases in the contributing community.
													  The goal of this project is to quantify and compare pathogen occurrence in the engineered water cycle for
														communities with direct, indirect, and de facto potable reuse, and develop a inform monitoring strategies for potable reuse. </p>

												<h4>Mechanisms of virus inactivation</h4>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
													<p>Enteric viruses in the engineered water cycle are generally quantified via culture methods or molecular methods.
														While culture methods are ideal for quantifying infectious viruses, molecular methods are still commonly used because
														they tend to have higher sensitivity and faster turnaround times and not all viruses are easily culturable.
														The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate molecular methods to assess enteric virus inactivation mechanisms and
														persistence in the engineered water cycle.</p>

												<h4>Enhanced microbial monitoring in the engineered water cycle</h4>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
													<p> Enhanced methods of
															microbial assessment include methods for microbial
															abundance (e.g., flow cytometry-based cell counts),
															microbial community composition (e.g., DNA
															sequencing), and specific microbial targets (e.g.,
															qPCR). The goal of this project is to combine high
															resolution enhanced microbial
															assessment data along with physicochemical water
															quality data and machine learning could aid in early
															identification of common issues in water systems.</p>

																	 <p><i>Spring 2024</i><br>
												           CE 2385 introduces the scientific knowledge applied to minimize environmental contaminants and their adverse impacts. Contaminants that impact environmental resources and human health are commonly controlled by applying fundamental concepts, for example from chemistry and fluid mechanics. In this course, students will learn how fundamental concepts can be applied to remove, transport, and/or transform contaminants in engineered and natural systems. This course introduces the principles of water quality engineering, air quality engineering, and hazardous waste management.

The course focuses on standard and EPA-approved methods to enumerate and isolate organisms used to assess risk of enteric illnesses, such as coliforms, enterococci, and coliphage, in drinking and recreational waters including lakes, streams, and coastal waters. The course includes a student project to assess the microbial water quality of a natural water.

									<h2>Join</h2>
									<p> Below you will find some frequently asked questions about joinning the Kennedy Water Lab.</p>
									<details>
										<summary><h4 style="display:inline-block">Who can join the research group?</h4></summary>
										<p>
										  Graduate student hiring is dependant on funding availability, but generally one graduate student (thesis-based MS or PhD) per year or two joins our research group. Funding availability is clear three to six months before the semester begins. Applicants should have a bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering, Civil Engineering, or a closely related field. In addition, applicants should demonstrate interest in microbiology in the engineered water cycle.     
										</p>
										<p> 
											Undergraduate students from UTEP are welcome and participate in the lab through research courses, undergraduate research assistantships (dependent on funding availability), or through <a href="https://www.utep.edu/couri/dept/for-ug-researchers/couri-programs/meritus-program.html">COURI</a>.
											Please contact <a href="mailto:lckennedy@utep.edu">Dr. Kennedy</a> to find out about current opportunities. 
										  </p>
									  </details>
									  
									  <details>
										<summary><h4 style="display:inline-block">How can I join the research group?</h4></summary>
										<p>
											Submit the required materials to the Civil Engineering program at <a href="https://www.utep.edu/graduate/apply-now/apply-now.html">The University of Texas at El Paso</a>. This will allow Dr. Kennedy to see your full application package to evaluate your fit in the research group. Dr. Kennedy cannot evaluate prospective students for admission to the Kennedy Water Lab outside of this process. Top applicants will also typically be interviewed by Dr. Kennedy. More information about the deadlines for the desired degree program can be found <a href="https://www.utep.edu/graduate/future-students/degrees-and-programs.html">here</a>.</p>
										</p>
									  </details>
									  <details>
										<summary><h4 style="display:inline-block">Should I mention Dr. Kennedy in my application to UTEP?</h4></summary>
										<p>
										  You may list Dr. Kennedy as a faculty member you are interested in working with. If you do so, Dr. Kennedy will be more likely to receive your application package to evaluate it. Dr. Kennedy cannot commit to supervising anyone without reviewing their application package submitted to the Civil Engineering program at <a href="https://www.utep.edu/graduate/apply-now/apply-now.html">The University of Texas at El Paso </a>.
										</p>
									  </details>
									  <details>
										<summary><h4 style="display:inline-block">What criteria are important for admission to the research group?</h4></summary>
										<p>
										  Prospective students with an environmental and/or civil engineering background with a demonstrated interest in microorganisms in the engineered water cycle are strong applicants. Prospective students with laboratory experience and/or strong written and oral communication skills are encouraged to apply. While these criteria are considered, they are not required of all successful candidates.  
										</p>
									  </details>
									  <details>
										<summary><h4 style="display:inline-block">Are there alternate opportunities to the thesis-based MS and PhD?</h4></summary>
										<p>
											If you are interested in a Master’s degree there are two unfunded options you could consider at UTEP:
 
											<li>A project-based Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering. For this you would need a faculty mentor and you would need to mention Dr. Kennedy or another faculty member in the application package and confirm whether they can advise you after acceptance. <a heref="https://www.utep.edu/engineering/civil/academic-programs/masters-program.html"> More information</a>.</li>
											<li>A course-based Master of Engineering in Civil and Environmental Engineering . For this you do not need a faculty mentor. <a heref="https://www.utep.edu/engineering/civil/academic-programs/masters-program.html"> More information</a>.</li>
										</p>
										<p>
											Submit the required materials to the Civil Engineering program at <a href="https://www.utep.edu/graduate/apply-now/apply-now.html">The University of Texas at El Paso</a>. More information about the deadlines for the desired degree program can be found <a href="https://www.utep.edu/graduate/future-students/degrees-and-programs.html">here</a>.</p>
